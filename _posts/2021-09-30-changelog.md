**Lockdown fixes:**
- Certain issues that could occur in **!lockdown** with certain permission setups, such as failing to restore original permissions, have been fixed

**Miscellaneous:**
- **!gettime** description has been updated to more clearly state that you can use a minus to get a timestamp in the past (such as `!gettime -30m`)
