                <h6>Become a patron, link your Discord account in your Patreon account settings and run <code>/upgrade</code> in one of your servers.</h6>

              <li>
                <h6>
                  Whenever Patreon charges you, the tokens you are granted will last (or be extended by) <strong>32 days</strong>.
