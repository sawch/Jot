            <h6>Supporting the bot on Patreon grants you upgrade tokens, which you apply to Discord servers with the <code>/upgrade</code> command. An upgraded server gets the following features:</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <h6>No command cooldowns</h6>

              </li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
            <h6>Additionally, any supporters (not just Patreon) get a fancy role and a private category in the <a href="{{ site.server_invite }}" target="_blank">Jot Discord server</a>!</h6>

            <h6>At this time, <strong>only Patreon members</strong> will receive upgrade tokens. You can become a patron with the button below!</h6>
            <h6>If your Discord account is linked with Patreon, the bot should automatically recognize you within 5 minutes of a successful pledge.</h6>
            <h6>Otherwise, DM the Jot on Patreon with your Discord ID, or DM an administrator in the <a href="{{ site.server_invite }}" target="_blank">Jot Discord server</a> to get your tokens. Note that this requires human interaction and can take way longer!</h6>

            <h6>Here is how the system works:</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <h6>Upgrade tokens are entirely automatic inside the bot! If you've linked your Discord account in Patreon, all you do is become a patron and run <code>/upgrade</code> to apply one to your server. You can freely move tokens between servers as many times and as often as you want.</h6>
                <a><img src="/jot/assets/img/examples/managetokens.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Manage tokens"></a>
              </li>
              <li><h6>The Patreon tier you pick will say how many tokens it gives you. The prices and token amounts will never change without at least a full month of warning.</h6></li>
              <li>
                <h6>
                  When Patreon charges you, the token(s) you are granted will last <strong>32 days</strong>. However, when you first become a patron you are granted bonus time equal to how late in the month it is:
                  If you become a patron on the 31st then get charged again the next day (the 1st), your tokens will last <strong>64 days</strong> because you didn't get those first 32 days. Those 32 extra days will not be consumed until after you've canceled your pledge!
                </h6>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h6>When your tokens expire (detailed in the panel above):</h6>
            <ul>
              <li><h6>Command cooldowns come back</h6></li>
              <li><h6>Existing button roles will remain fully functional, you just can't fully customize any new ones you create</h6></li>
